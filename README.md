## Overview
This is my solution to the [Build a Product Landing Page Challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page). 

### The challenge

- This is the 3/5 challenge of the Responsive Web Certification from freecodecamp. Basically consist on create a product landing page using our creativity and aplying the knowledge adquired on the course. 
Then I had some requirements to follow in the development process and I have tested an passed all of it.
I chose to create a landing page for a job-posting service in order to publish recruitment ads for web3. I thought about all the design and it was my first time I did this. It was great and I felt comfortable with the process.

## My process

### Built with

- Desktop first workflow
- Responsive design
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SASS for nesting, module and custom properties
- Control version system using Git

### What I learned

This is my third project for this certifaction and I felt comfortable doing it. I started with an idea and I was be able to get it. I like the "final" result (The project has litle things that I would like to improve but it's okay for now)
I used SASS to nesting and partials in order to module my code. I used a pattern to organize the project like an architecture but adapted for this small web.
Also I learned more about web design. Then I used git in order to handle the versions of the project.
I'll keep working on it.

### Continued development

I'm really excited to keep learning about frontend technologies, specially about going into javascript in order to create dynamic webs, I'll work on that when I feel confortable with my HTML/CSS skills. I'll keep learning git too because it's important and useful tool for co-working.
